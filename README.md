# react-ts-app-starter

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A CLI app that sets up a app.

The app is using the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

1. `npm i -g react-ts-app-starter`

## Usage

You can create your [React](https://reactjs.org/) project with the following command:

`react-ts-app-starter name_of_your_project`

This command creates a new directory for your app under the current path.

It then creates all further needed sub-directories and files.

Lastly, this command sets up the newly created project as a Git repository (`git init`) and installs all npm dependencies (`npm install`) afterwards.
